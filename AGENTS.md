# Coding Guidelines

## Definition of Done

- All tests, including browser tests, pass
- The <README.md> file is updated with relevant pending changes

## Naming Conventions

### Collections

All collection variables should use the prefix "collection" for consistency and clarity.

Examples:

Examples:

- `noteCollection` instead of `notes`
- `pentatonicBoxNoteCollection` instead of `pentatonicBoxNotes`
- `fullRangeNoteCollection` instead of `fullRangeNotes`

### State

State is to be supported by local storage and querystring
